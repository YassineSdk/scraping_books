0,The Arabian Nights Entertainments,Anonymous,"There is no occasion to prepossess the reader with an opinion of the merit and beauty of the following work. There needs no more but to read it to satisfy any man, that hitherto nothing so fine of this nature has appeared in any language.What can be more ingenious than to compose such a prodigious quantity of pleasant stories, whose variety is surprising, and whose connexion is so wonderful? We know not the name of the author of so great a work; but probably it is not all done by one hand; for how can we suppose that one man alone could have invention enough to make so many fine things?",1813,"26,627",https://manybooks.net/titles/anonetext04arne110.html
1,Abandoned,Jules Verne,"The present romance, the second in the Mysterious Island triad, was originally issued in Paris with the title of L'Abandonné. Jules Verne's list of stories already ran then to some twenty volumes—a number which has since grown to almost Dumasien proportions.

Its success in both forms seems to have established a record in the race for popularity and a circulation in both the French and English fields of current literature. The present book was translated into English by the late W. H. G. Kingston",1909,"25,523",https://manybooks.net/titles/vernejul3351633516-8.html

It is home to Creatures of Legend, all-powerful gods and goddesses, lost Ancients, reclusive First Bloods, and the Guardian of the Core. All life flows in and out of the system. Should it cease, the universe ceases to exist as well. That is why it is the Guardian’s duty to protect the system at all costs. However, his time is coming to a close and he needs to hold Trials to select his next apprentice.

A haughty, yet competent prince, Hydro Paen, longs to seize the Power of the Guardian and show to everyone who has doubted him that he is worthy of his lineage.

Under the guidance of his uncle, orphan Eirek Mourse participates, hoping only to survive such Trials and having no idea how he was even accepted in the first place.

And a tactician, Zain Berrese, always living in the shadow of his stepbrother’s accomplishments, wants to prove that he is capable of overcoming his haunted past and excelling further than his rivals.

None of these participants, however, know that the Trials will pit them against others who are just as conniving, talented, and motivated to win. None of them know that the Trials will test them in ways unimaginable. And none of them know that, by participating, it might mean the rendering of their identity and the forfeiting of their lives.

With their lives and identities on the line, will one of these would-be heroes find the inner strength and wisdom to emerge a champion and impress the Guardian before the system collapses?

A perfect sci-fantasy story for those who love Game of Thrones, Hunger Games, and Eragon. Buy today and experience the Trials for yourself!",2015,"3,818",https://manybooks.net/titles/the-trials-of-the-core

None of them know that the Trials will test them in ways unimaginable. And none of them know that, by participating, it might mean the rendering of their identity and the forfeiting of their lives.

With their lives and identities on the line, will one of these would-be heroes find the inner strength and wisdom to emerge a champion and impress the Guardian before the system collapses?

It is home to Creatures of Legend, all-powerful gods and goddesses, lost Ancients, reclusive First Bloods, and the Guardian of the Core. All life flows in and out of the system. Should it cease, the universe ceases to exist as well. That is why it is the Guardian’s duty to protect the system at all costs. However, his time is coming to a close and he needs to hold Trials to select his next apprentice.

A haughty, yet competent prince, Hydro Paen, longs to seize the Power of the Guardian and show to everyone who has doubted him that he is worthy of his lineage.

Under the guidance of his uncle, orphan Eirek Mourse participates, hoping only to survive such Trials and having no idea how he was even accepted in the first place.

And a tactician, Zain Berrese, always living in the shadow of his stepbrother’s accomplishments, wants to prove that he is capable of overcoming his haunted past and excelling further than his rivals.

None of these participants, however, know that the Trials will pit them against others who are just as conniving, talented, and motivated to win. None of them know that the Trials will test them in ways unimaginable. And none of them know that, by participating, it might mean the rendering of their identity and the forfeiting of their lives.

With their lives and identities on the line, will one of these would-be heroes find the inner strength and wisdom to emerge a champion and impress the Guardian before the system collapses?

A perfect sci-fantasy story for those who love Game of Thrones, Hunger Games, and Eragon. Buy today and experience the Trials for yourself!",2015,"3,818",https://manybooks.net/titles/the-trials-of-the-core

It is home to Creatures of Legend, all-powerful gods and goddesses, lost Ancients, reclusive First Bloods, and the Guardian of the Core. All life flows in and out of the system. Should it cease, the universe ceases to exist as well. That is why it is the Guardian’s duty to protect the system at all costs. However, his time is coming to a close and he needs to hold Trials to select his next apprentice.

A haughty, yet competent prince, Hydro Paen, longs to seize the Power of the Guardian and show to everyone who has doubted him that he is worthy of his lineage.

Under the guidance of his uncle, orphan Eirek Mourse participates, hoping only to survive such Trials and having no idea how he was even accepted in the first place.

And a tactician, Zain Berrese, always living in the shadow of his stepbrother’s accomplishments, wants to prove that he is capable of overcoming his haunted past and excelling further than his rivals.

None of these participants, however, know that the Trials will pit them against others who are just as conniving, talented, and motivated to win. None of them know that the Trials will test them in ways unimaginable. And none of them know that, by participating, it might mean the rendering of their identity and the forfeiting of their lives.

With their lives and identities on the line, will one of these would-be heroes find the inner strength and wisdom to emerge a champion and impress the Guardian before the system collapses?

A perfect sci-fantasy story for those who love Game of Thrones, Hunger Games, and Eragon. Buy today and experience the Trials for yourself!",2015,"3,818",https://manybooks.net/titles/the-trials-of-the-core

Should it cease, the universe ceases to exist as well. That is why it is the Guardian’s duty to protect the system at all costs. However, his time is coming to a close and he needs to hold Trials to select his next apprentice.

A haughty, yet competent prince, Hydro Paen, longs to seize the Power of the Guardian and show to everyone who has doubted him that he is worthy of his lineage.

Under the guidance of his uncle, orphan Eirek Mourse participates, hoping only to survive such Trials and having no idea how he was even accepted in the first place.

And a tactician, Zain Berrese, always living in the shadow of his stepbrother’s accomplishments, wants to prove that he is capable of overcoming his haunted past and excelling further than his rivals.

None of these participants, however, know that the Trials will pit them against others who are just as conniving, talented, and motivated to win. None of them know that the Trials will test them in ways unimaginable. And none of them know that, by participating, it might mean the rendering of their identity and the forfeiting of their lives.

With their lives and identities on the line, will one of these would-be heroes find the inner strength and wisdom to emerge a champion and impress the Guardian before the system collapses?

371,The Trials of the Core,Michael E. Thies,"The system of Gladonus is unlike any other.

It is home to Creatures of Legend, all-powerful gods and goddesses, lost Ancients, reclusive First Bloods, and the Guardian of the Core. All life flows in and out of the system. Should it cease, the universe ceases to exist as well. That is why it is the Guardian’s duty to protect the system at all costs. However, his time is coming to a close and he needs to hold Trials to select his next apprentice.

A haughty, yet competent prince, Hydro Paen, longs to seize the Power of the Guardian and show to everyone who has doubted him that he is worthy of his lineage.

Under the guidance of his uncle, orphan Eirek Mourse participates, hoping only to survive such Trials and having no idea how he was even accepted in the first place.

And a tactician, Zain Berrese, always living in the shadow of his stepbrother’s accomplishments, wants to prove that he is capable of overcoming his haunted past and excelling further than his rivals.

None of these participants, however, know that the Trials will pit them against others who are just as conniving, talented, and motivated to win. None of them know that the Trials will test them in ways unimaginable. And none of them know that, by participating, it might mean the rendering of their identity and the forfeiting of their lives.

With their lives and identities on the line, will one of these would-be heroes find the inner strength and wisdom to emerge a champion and impress the Guardian before the system collapses?

It is home to Creatures of Legend, all-powerful gods and goddesses, lost Ancients, reclusive First Bloods, and the Guardian of the Core. All life flows in and out of the system. Should it cease, the universe ceases to exist as well. That is why it is the Guardian’s duty to protect the system at all costs. However, his time is coming to a close and he needs to hold Trials to select his next apprentice.

A haughty, yet competent prince, Hydro Paen, longs to seize the Power of the Guardian and show to everyone who has doubted him that he is worthy of his lineage.

Under the guidance of his uncle, orphan Eirek Mourse participates, hoping only to survive such Trials and having no idea how he was even accepted in the first place.

And a tactician, Zain Berrese, always living in the shadow of his stepbrother’s accomplishments, wants to prove that he is capable of overcoming his haunted past and excelling further than his rivals.

None of these participants, however, know that the Trials will pit them against others who are just as conniving, talented, and motivated to win. None of them know that the Trials will test them in ways unimaginable. And none of them know that, by participating, it might mean the rendering of their identity and the forfeiting of their lives.

With their lives and identities on the line, will one of these would-be heroes find the inner strength and wisdom to emerge a champion and impress the Guardian before the system collapses?

466,The Half-Hearted,John Buchan,"To say that Mr. John Buchan's novel, The Half-Hearted, is a ""psychological study,"" would be to arouse in the breasts of many novel readers a dark, but unfounded suspicion; to describe it as a splendid story of adventure would be paying tribute to but a part of its sterling merit, for it is a book far above the average, out of the common in conception, and very well written. Englishmen have been warning each other for some time against possible dangers at home and abroad, and this novel, whether that danger be imaginary or not, will probably be taken into consideraton as one of the ablest efforts in this direction, whatever be the need of its cry.

478,The Trials of the Core,Michael E. Thies,"The system of Gladonus is unlike any other.

It is home to Creatures of Legend, all-powerful gods and goddesses, lost Ancients, reclusive First Bloods, and the Guardian of the Core. All life flows in and out of the system. Should it cease, the universe ceases to exist as well. That is why it is the Guardian’s duty to protect the system at all costs. However, his time is coming to a close and he needs to hold Trials to select his next apprentice.

A haughty, yet competent prince, Hydro Paen, longs to seize the Power of the Guardian and show to everyone who has doubted him that he is worthy of his lineage.

Under the guidance of his uncle, orphan Eirek Mourse participates, hoping only to survive such Trials and having no idea how he was even accepted in the first place.

And a tactician, Zain Berrese, always living in the shadow of his stepbrother’s accomplishments, wants to prove that he is capable of overcoming his haunted past and excelling further than his rivals.

None of these participants, however, know that the Trials will pit them against others who are just as conniving, talented, and motivated to win. None of them know that the Trials will test them in ways unimaginable. And none of them know that, by participating, it might mean the rendering of their identity and the forfeiting of their lives.

With their lives and identities on the line, will one of these would-be heroes find the inner strength and wisdom to emerge a champion and impress the Guardian before the system collapses?

A perfect sci-fantasy story for those who love Game of Thrones, Hunger Games, and Eragon. Buy today and experience the Trials for yourself!",2015,"3,818",https://manybooks.net/titles/the-trials-of-the-core
